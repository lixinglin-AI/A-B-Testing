# A/B Testing

A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which performs better. This HTML file provides a framework for creating such tests with responsive design and code highlighting features.

## Features of the HTML

1. **Responsive Design**:
   - The `<meta>` tag ensures the webpage scales to different devices.
   - Example: 
     ```html
     <meta content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" name="viewport"/>
     ```

2. **Code Syntax Highlighting**:
   - Styles for presenting code blocks and comments are included, making the content developer-friendly.
   - Example of styles for highlighted code:
     ```css
     .highlight .k { color: var(--jp-mirror-editor-keyword-color); font-weight: bold; }
     ```

3. **RequireJS Integration**:
   - The file includes RequireJS, enabling modular JavaScript development.
   - Example:
     ```html
     <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/require.js/2.1.10/require.min.js"></script>
     ```
